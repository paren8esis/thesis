Master's Thesis at ECE NTUA
===========================

A novel approach to the clustering of gene expression data obtained by cDNA microarray experiments. In this thesis we propose the creation of a 3D structure which contains the chromosome pairs as a third dimension. Afterwards we apply different clustering methods, i.e. k-Means and Î´-TRIMAX.
